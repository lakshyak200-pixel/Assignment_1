1. The Mini-Calculator (math.py)
What it does: Takes two numbers and instantly spits out the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division results.
The Vibe: It's your basic pocket calculator, but built from scratch.
Key Lesson: Converting user "text" into "integers" so Python can actually do math with them.
Pro Tip: Great for checking if your math homework is right!

3. The Personal Greeter (hello.py)
What it does: Asks for your first and last name, then gives you a custom "Welcome to Python" shoutout.
The Vibe: A digital "Hello, my name is..." sticker.
Key Lesson: Using f-strings—the cleanest way to inject variables directly into a sentence without messy plus signs.
Pro Tip: It’s the first step in building any app that needs a "User Profile."
